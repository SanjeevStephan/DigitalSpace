# I thought I was stupid and a failure, then I found this

Why do I hate traditional education?

 

Let me tell you a story…

 

School killed my spirit.

 

I bet it killed yours whether you realize it or not.

 

School left me feeling like I was stupid and a failure.

 

I wrote the bestselling personal finance book of all-time… but failed writing class… twice.

 

But when I got older, I started taking seminars. Now I learn through my computer.

 

I discovered that I am not stupid, I just learn differently. I didn’t respond to an arrogant teacher whose only experience in the world was picking a job with a pension.

 

I need to learn from someone who DOES and who communicates through sharing experiences rather than theory.

 

I became a junkie of learning from REAL teachers, going from seminar to seminar.

 

I became a student of education outside the school system.

 

This REAL education gave me a sense of empowerment and self as well as teaching me many different REAL paths to find success (I have tried and succeeded in many).

 

You can succeed too.

 

First, repair your spirit from the destruction of the school system caused by finding REAL teachers. 

 

Second, go out and take action by following the actions and teachings of REAL educators.
