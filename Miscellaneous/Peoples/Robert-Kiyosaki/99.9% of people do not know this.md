# 99.9% of people do not know this

As the global financial crisis spreads and the Fed prints more and more money to try to save the U.S. economy…

 

The average person is wondering how they can avoid being caught in the next crash.

 

First, you must understand that the mess the U.S. is in has been happening since 2008. Mortgage-backed securities were the pin that popped the bubble in 2008, and the pin today is the coronavirus—not the cause.

 

The real cause of the economic problems is what 99.9% of the people can’t see—the structure of the economy itself. Guest George Gammon, American real estate investor, and entrepreneur, says, “Whether it was mortgage-backed securities or Covid-19, it doesn’t matter, sooner or later, a system that is broken will finally break.”
