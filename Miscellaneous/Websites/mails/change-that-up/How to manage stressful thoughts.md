Here's Today's Tip... Manage Your Stress.

There’s no question the past several weeks (or has it been months?) have been stressful; that might even be the understatement of the year.

While short-term stress is a key ingredient for growth and success, when it’s persistent and long-lasting, stress can be an absolute bear, adversely affecting every possible corner of deep health, negatively impacting your mood, bodily functions and overall wellness.

According to recent Harris Poll findings regarding U.S. adults’ perceptions of the current health crisis, more than two in five (41%) of Americans say they are most concerned  about experiencing increased anxiety -- even more so than not being able to pay their bills (33%), reduced job salary/work hours (26%) or losing their job/not being able to get a new job (22%).

More than 2 in 3 Americans (68%) say they feel like everything is out of their control right now, and more than half (56%) say they are balancing more now than ever before during the current pandemic.

In short, we are collectively under a lot of stress, and as it relates to our current landscape, chronic stress can weaken the immune system, making you more susceptible to getting sick, and when you do, making symptoms worse and longer lasting.

Simply put, the more stressed you are, the more likely you are to get sick -- really sick.

It’s not all bad news. In fact, there’s some really good news: There are ways to manage stress. Here are some of our top strategies for managing stressful thoughts (and promoting a healthy response to stress):

Deep, mindful breathing, such as box breathing; simply taking six deep breaths can be enough to lower stress hormones and promote feelings of relaxation
Daily prayer
Practicing gratitude
Meditation for 10 - 30 minutes a day (Not sure where to start? Try the app Headspace.)
Spending time outdoors (One of our favorite ways is forest bathing, which is a Japanese practice that involves taking a leisurely walk outdoors in nature.)
Grounding, or earthing, which entails walking outside barefoot, connected to the Earth’s surface
Exercise, particularly parasympathetic-dominant activities like yoga
Hot and cold therapy, such as sauna bathing and cold/contrast showers
Connecting with your social support network
Singing, dancing, humming and chanting, which can all activate the vagus nerve and the body’s “rest and relaxation” response
Those strategies can go a long way to helping ground you (physically, mentally and spiritually) while also helping manage stressful thoughts and feelings of anxiousness.

And let’s face it, those thoughts and feelings are on virtually everyone’s menu right now, making now, more than ever, a time when we need to implement all the tips, tricks and stress-relieving tactics we can to help promote better choices and an overall healthier, more balanced mind, body and spirit.
