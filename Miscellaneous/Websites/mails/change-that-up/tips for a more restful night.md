Here's Today's Tip... Trouble Sleeping?

We don’t know about you, but a good night’s sleep has been hard to come by lately (and it’s not just because several of us at Change That Up have multiple children under the age of 4, including infants…although that surely doesn’t help).

Whether it’s tail-spinning thoughts of uncertainty, staying up too late watching the news, scrolling through all the (mis)information on social feeds…if your sleep has taken a hit -- in terms of both the amount and the quality -- then you’re setting the table for trouble.

On one hand, sleeping fewer than seven hours can make you 3 TIMES more likely to get sick, and if you’ve found yourself tossing and turning during the night, poor sleep quality can make you up to 5 ½ TIMES more likely to come down with a virus.

In short, inadequate, poor quality sleep is a surefire way to weaken your immune system and increase your odds of getting sick.

Of course, burning the candle at both ends can have other hidden costs, contributing to a long list of health problems related to heart health, blood sugar management, mood, weight management, skin health, cognitive function and more.

Heck, even a single night of bad sleep can lead to noticeable problems, such as fatigue, poor decision making, brain fog, out-of-control cravings, mood swings, feeling anxious, being more accident prone, having a lower sex drive and more.

The good news is that the odds of you enjoying a good night’s sleep are set before your head even hits the pillow, and for most people, it comes down to healthy sleep hygiene, which research has shown to effectively improve sleep quality and quantity.

Here are some of the most common sleep hygiene tips:

Maintain a regular bed and wake time. (Remember, you can’t get 8 hours of sleep if you’re only in bed for 6.)
Make your bedroom dark, cool (between 60 – 67°F) and quiet. (It doesn’t have to be dead silent; most people will do well with some consistent white noise.)
Avoid caffeine and other stimulants prior to sleep. (Generally speaking, most people should avoid caffeine after 2pm.)
Avoid light-emitting technological devices in the hours prior to sleep. (That includes phones, tablets and computers; if they are necessary, use blue-light-blocking glasses to minimize the damage.)
Implement relaxation strategies before bed. (Try meditation and deep breathing exercises.)
Go to bed before midnight. (“Every hour before midnight is worth two after.”)
Get bright outdoor light during the day, preferably within the first hour or so of waking. (This fosters the natural rise in cortisol, suppressing melatonin and increasing levels of serotonin.)
Take a hot shower/bath about an hour or two before bed. (This “tricks” the body into cooling down more rapidly, which is a trigger for sleep.)
If you are able to clean up your sleep hygiene doing most of those things consistently -- you don’t have to be perfect; nobody is -- you’ll be markedly improving your odds of getting a good, restful night of sleep.
